  # Spring Boot Tutorial
  Modern java programming is a little different from the way we do it in class where we are building up our own classes from scratch and largely working on our own code by ourselves. 

  It also doesn't normally live in a Terminal Console text window.

  It is web-based and team based.

  To give you some exposure to that, I want you to take a look at Spring Boot, which is a framework for building web-apps. To make it work, you are going to use a large amount of code built by someone else and you will need to learn how to import and manage modules that come from the outside world.

  Seeing this in real practice, I believe will give you an added appreciation for things like Classes, Interfaces, and Exception Handling which are all pieces of Java designed to help make your code accessible to other programmers rather than to mearly make the app work.

To get started, I would like you to take a look at this Quick-Start Guide:

I suspect you will have a bit of trouble getting used to downloading libraries, re-uploading them to your replit project, and then organizing your replit project into package directores. None-the-less, I would like you to start by following the guide, so I can better see what you find difficult.

If you succeed in making a Spring Boot Messaging client using Sockets and can explain it, I will give you an A you can apply to your worst grade in the class.

Above is the next module that shows step-by-step how to build a messaging app.
